## Introduction

I've had a hard time to make tensorflow run on my Windows PC. I was able to install it successfully, but whenever I execute `import tensorflow as tf` in my python, I got errors saying "DLL file not found". I was able to use tensorflow 1.1.0 successfully before, but new versions seem to have this issue all the time.

I gave up on installing tensorflow on my Windows PC, and tried to seek some alternatives. I figured out google Colaboratory could faciliate my learning, so I gave it a try, and it works pretty well.

Two things of interest to me are:

[1] How do I import other third party and custom packages in google colab?
[2] How do I read large numbers of data files from google drive?
